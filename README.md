## X-TransferBench
**X-TransferBench** is an open-source benchmark that offers a comprehensive collection of Universal Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) capable of achieving super adversarial transferability. These UAPs can simultaneously transfer **across data distributions, domains, model architectures**, and **downstream tasks**. In essence, they are perturbations that can convert virtually *any input sample* into an adversarial exampleâ€”effective against *any model* and *any task*.

## Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hanxunh/XTransferBench.git
cd XTransferBench
pip3 install .
```

---
## Usage
```python
import XTransferBench
import XTransferBench.zoo

# List threat models
print(XTransferBench.zoo.list_threat_model())

# List UAPs under L_inf threat model
print(XTransferBench.zoo.list_attacker('linf_non_targeted'))

# Load X-Transfer with the Large search space (N=64) non-targeted
attacker = XTransferBench.zoo.load_attacker('linf_non_targeted', 'xtransfer_large_linf_eps12_non_targeted')

# Perturbe images to adversarial example
images = # Tensor [b, 3, h, w]
adv_images = attacker(images) 
```
